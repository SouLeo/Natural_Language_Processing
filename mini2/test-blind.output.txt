tensor(0)	it 's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry 's cold - fish act makes the experience worthwhile .
tensor(0)	at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .
tensor(0)	frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate UNK scenes .
tensor(0)	UNK manages to nail the spirit - crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it .
tensor(1)	adam sandler 's eight crazy nights grows on you - - like a rash .

tensor(1)	all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign - trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow .
tensor(1)	deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that UNK shamelessly from farewell - to - innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
tensor(1)	the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it 's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .

tensor(1)	with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , h l ne angel is definitely a director to watch .
tensor(0)	director nancy savoca 's no - frills record of a show forged in still - raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9 - 11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could .
tensor(1)	with the film 's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved .
tensor(1)	but the power of these subjects is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .

tensor(0)	tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
tensor(0)	the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds .

tensor(1)	miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .
tensor(0)	it 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
tensor(0)	a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 .
tensor(1)	they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .

tensor(0)	an improvement on the feeble examples of big - screen poke - mania that have preceded it .
tensor(0)	the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off - putting .
tensor(0)	a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd .
tensor(1)	not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog .
tensor(1)	while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross - out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct - to - video irrelevancy .
tensor(0)	cannon 's confidence and laid - back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film 's saving graces .
tensor(0)	like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .
tensor(0)	a semi - autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .

tensor(1)	because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , UNK left me with a very bad feeling .
tensor(1)	slap me , i saw this movie .
tensor(1)	lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree .
tensor(0)	impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .

tensor(0)	an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
tensor(1)	although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another major league .

tensor(1)	an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
tensor(1)	it 's not difficult to spot the culprit early - on in this predictable thriller .
tensor(1)	it 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .

tensor(0)	. . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family .

tensor(1)	not only unfunny , but downright repellent .

tensor(1)	tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better .
tensor(0)	it 's rare to find a film to which the adjective UNK applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline paulette .

tensor(0)	lightweight but appealing .
tensor(1)	though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog 's works , invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .

tensor(0)	. . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not - so - stock characters .
tensor(1)	this re - do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .

tensor(1)	vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop .
tensor(1)	the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
tensor(1)	light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
tensor(1)	crackerjack entertainment - - nonstop romance , music , suspense and action .
tensor(0)	. . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .
tensor(0)	brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate .

tensor(0)	maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards .
tensor(1)	gayton 's script telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
